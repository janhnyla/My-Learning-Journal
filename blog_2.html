            <h1>My first Scrimba course</h1>
            
            <p class="heading-text">As I mentioned in my <a href="about.html">description</a>, I already know
            a lot of coding. Php, Mysql, CSS, HTML5 was already stuff I had used. I also had
            used some Javascript, but mostly as copy-paste-adjust from internet. Time to learn for real.</p>

            <h3>Searching for help.</h3>
            <p>The first years after thinking that this was way to complex for me to achieve on my own, I used
            <a href="http://www.freelancer.com" target="_blank">Freelancer.com</a> and tried to find a programmer
            who could do it for me. Boy - that was an experience. The first time, I made an agreement with someone who thought
            they could do it in a couple of weeks. I even payed a deposit on $50 so he could get started.
            Two weeks went, I got to se how far he had come, and it was way off what I was looking for. So, I took the deposit back, and put 
            the project to rest.
            </p>

            <p>I have tried two more times hiring someone, but the last two times, those who reached out turned down the project, it was simply to hard and time consuming.</p>
            <h3>I better find someone who can teach me.</h3>
            <p>I first enrolled Udemy.com, and figured that was a good place to learn Javascript. But it was not for me. So, by chance - when searching the net for answers - I came over Scrimba.</p>    
            <p>Wow! What a way of learning programming!! Coding directly into the "video" is simply brilliant. It was also a Norwegian teacher, even if it was on English - it is much easier for me to 
                understand a Norwegian talking English than and Indian doing the same. This was brilliant, and on this date (20.september), I got
                enrolled in the free Javascript course "Learn JavaScript for free"
            </p>

            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>

            What we make in this course is:
            <ul>
                <li>Passenger counter app</li>
                <li>Blackjack game</li>
                <li>Chrome Extension</li>
                <li>Solo Project: Basketball Scoreboard</li>
                <li>Solo Project: Password Generator</li>
                <li>Solo Project: Unit Converter</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Quite a bit! But boy, it was really fun. You pretty much learn a whole deal of the basics with Javascript, but also so much more.
            The way the teaching is done, is brilliant. You end up coding all those project on your own, even though the 
            teacher coding it after you the right way, but in the end - you write the code. </p>
            <p>There is so much to mention on what you are learning, I suggest you look it up your self, and have it a go. It is a Free course!. What I got from it was a whole lot.
                Specially how to deal with arrays and objects, and to build proper functions.</p>

            <h3>The solo projects</h3>
            <h2>--> Basketball Scoreboard</h2>
            <p>This was a way of learning to set up buttons with functions, and do easy mathematics in functions. It was quite fun, And
                I learned a lot. My project can be found <a href="https://mellifluous-squirrel-da6db9.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>, if  you want to look at it. 
            </p>
            <h2>--> Password Generator</h2>
            <p>Learning use of Math functionality, and randomness. Not to hard this one, but a good way of learning how to use
                Math.floor and Math in generall. My project is <a href="https://gentle-treacle-359196.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here.</a>
            </p>
            <h2>--> Unit Converter</h2>
            <p>Hmmm. This is strange. I did not do that part in this course, I am pretty sure I did it in one of my later courses. So I 
                will not say so much about this now. But if you take that course now, this is one of the projects.
            </p>

            <p>Next to come: trial - signup and my next course</p>
