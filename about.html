                    <p class="heading-text">Years ago, I came over a brilliant website, with a genius script. 
                        It gave me inspiration for my own project. Join me in my quest for making my dream come true.

            <h2>My road to finishing my dream project.</h2>
            <p>When I discovered this script, I tried to understand how it was made. So I opened the source code, and 
                wow! It was so complex, I really did not understand the coding. I figured out what he had done, and how it worked, but 
                no clue how the coding worked. So I tried to reach out to the website owner. But sadly, he had not 
                made it. It was made from an brilliant proffessor at a University, and he sadly had passed away.
            </p>

            <p> My intention was not to steal the idea, or the script - but to make one of my own. Since this was made
                years ago, it was not a responsive layout, and I had so many idea to make it work even better.
            </p>
            <h2>How I got started</h2>
            <p>First, I thought it should be easy to find answer on the web, and learning Javascript. I had already motivated
                4 websites, and a booking-script for a client - but it turned out that it should not be easy. I worked as CEO in 
                a company, and life simply took over. So for years, this was just a dream I had laying in the back of my head to take
                up again my quest.
            </p>    
            <p>Then the pandemic came. My company struggled hard, and this year in August we had to give it up. The travelling business
                simply did not survive. This really gave me time to pick up again this idea. And my search on the web 
                to really learn programming came back. This blog will take you with me on the hunt for the perfect
                project.
