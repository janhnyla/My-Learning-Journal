            <h3>Solo Project completed!</h3>
            <p>Since my last update, I have pretty much worked with the soloproject. It is an Quiz-app, which fetch API from a source. As you may now,
                I skipped the module about API. . . So it got very hard, and I tell you, I did it not with any help. I searched GitHub for someones solution,
                tried to figure out that code (copied the API-fetching bit), and then tried to get the solution in order.
            </p>

           <h3>CODE ERROR</h3>
            <p>Let me say it once and for all: React is not kind with the error-codes. So many times you just get a none-saying error which just 
                make you crazy. Where are the fxxxxking error? It got alot easier when I decided to do the project in VS. With Ninja installed, you 
                get console.log directly in the script, and made it much easier. 
            </p>
            <h3>Deployment to Netlify</h3>
            <p>There is a bug or some wrongness with the npm from Scrimba. I followed instruction for uploading, but did not work. Luckily, we have
                the Scrimba Discord community, and someone gave me the solution for an update of webpackage. And then it worked!!

            <h3>Whats up Next for me? </h3>
            <p>Christmas Holiday! And then NEW JOB! I am now taking a break in the studies, and concentrate on my family and my new job next 
                couple of weeks. Then, maybe mid January, I pick it up again, but then only evening studies, couple hours 2-3 days per week. Will be
                harder, but I still havent learned what I actually wanted to learn: how to move around objects in the DOM. Until then, Marry Christmas
                Y'all!!
