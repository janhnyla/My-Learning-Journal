                to use som extra time with this one, making a real learning journal! The one you read right now!

            <h3>Responsive design</h3>
            <p>This module focus on teaching you doing responsive, and thinking responsive. This is really important when
                you make websites, since most people read websites on their phones. Think mobile first is something  you
                learn to do, then scale up. Not the other way around. 
            </p>
            <p>In this course,  you will learn about position:relative and :absolute. You will learn to go away from 
                always using pixels as the size-measure and using Rem and Em instead. This and much more in this course is 
                keys to unlock the true power of good programming. 
            </p>
            <h3>The Grid-Box!</h3>

            <p>The last section is with Kevin Powell, a true CSS master. I have followed his Youtube Channel for a long time,
                and when he takes a deep dive into Grid-Box, you know you should pay attention. I actually had to take this 
                section twice, because I understood what power using Grid is, and wanted to learn it good. I still dont 
                think I have learned enough about it, because Grid is real cool. Take your time when you come to this part!
            </p>
            <p>The Soloproject in this module is what you read right now. It is to make a Learning Journal. The easy way is 
                to just make 3 layouts/sites with the standard text given in the Figma-file, I desided to make it real, and 
                really write a blog about my learning process and the way to completing my project. Feel free to follow me in 
                the quest :)
            </p>
            <p>There is no need to add JavaScript in this module, but it came very clear to me when I make 10 pages as I have done
                that it is best to render out those small thumbnails for blog-post. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Whats next for me? </h3>
            <p>I have now completed Module 1 to 7, so I guess module 8? Well, I have reconsidered. As I have mentioned earlier, I start
                in a new job January 2, and I need to come further with my own project. So I think I skip for now module 8 - 10, and 
                go straight to module 11: React Basics. I think module 11 and 12 is what I need now, so I can continue my project, and 
                then go back for 8-10 later after I have started my new job.
