            <h3>Understanding</h3>
            <p>The first thing I noticed after starting with Scrimba, is that I understand much more of coding I have seen or 
                used in the past. You can find much on internet that is freecode, and just do some "tweeks" on it to suit
                what you need. But it is quite different when you actually understand what you're doing!
            </p>
            <p>As I have mentioned in the <a href="about.html">About me</a> section, I have seen a script that I want to - not 
                copy, but to use as a foundation for making my own. It will be nowhere simular to that, but use same teqniques.
                So, after 3 courses, I know what I have to do. But did Scrimba teach me how? Lets check, step by step through what
                I need to do: 


            <h3>Step one, the url</h3>
            <p>I need the url for my site to be like this: www.mysite.com/name - so no index.html or another file. 
            this way, all sites use same index-file. It is not necessary, but it looks better, and I need to grab hold
            of the "name" in both my php and JavaScript. Have not found this solution on Scrimba, but found it by Googling.
            Solution is to add a line of code in your .htaccess file (if you have Apache server): DirectoryIndex index.html</p>

            
            <p>I have not tested this yet, as I am still working on the project on Live Server through Visual Code (so locally).
            </p>
            <h3>Step 2, combining 2 arrays</h3>
            <p>When I get the "name", I want to grap this through slicing, and save it as a variable. Next: I have two arrays.
                The first one (lets call it "a") is an array with default object keys and values. The second one ("b"), holds
                objects with same keys, but with values that should replace those in "a". And of course, only a few of them in
                each object; only those who is different than the defaults in Array a. Each of these objects have a name-key, and I 
                must find the object in "b" that has the same name as the "name" I have stored in the variable.
            </p>
            <p>This was easy after learning JavaScript: 
                <ul>
                    <li>const nameVariable = "name" (this one still hardcoded)</li>
                    <li>const findName = b[`${nameVariable}`]</li>
                </ul>
            Thats it. Not so hard. Next, I need to mix array a and b, and do it so the new values in array b override the 
            ones in a-array. This one I had to find on the net, and also that was easy: 
                <ul>
                    <li>const c = {...a,...b}</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This is a new way to write the concat() function, if you wanna look it up. Make sure that the array with the 
                values you want to keep is the last one. 
            </p>

            <h3>Step 3: use the new array</h3>
            <p>When I now has the c-array, I will use those keys and values to a) build the website layout, and b) make rules
                for what happens when someone interact with the website. I should probably now mention that my b-array holds about
                500 different objects, which means 500 different websites. I have calculated that I need about 12 different layouts,
                and all builds with changing the variables, and use the c array for this.
            </p>
            <p>I have manage to code the layout problem, but I really feel like I have used some old-fashioned code for it. 
                I will probably use some of the new ways we have learned with use of arrows and ternary gonna make it easier, 
                but still I think I need to learn more. But I at least manage to: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Build the different layouts</li>
                    <li>rendering content to the page</li>
                </ul>
                That last one bothers me. I am able to, lets say put an image to the site. But when someone interact with it, how
                should the code recognise what array it comes from? Because I first must put the different items to render in a new 
                array, and These are made in the "building layout" process, and can be everything from 1 to 30 different arrays.
            </p>
            <p>I realized here that I still have much to learn, and after having a sneak peak on what to come later in the 
                "Frontend Developer Career", I think using React is the solution. So I stopped working on the project right here. 
                Another reason I stoppes, was that I discovered that my CSS skills actually was somewhat like my previous Javascript skills, 
                I not bits of it, and the websites i already have made is made by trying and failing. On to CSS then, and optimistic as I 
                am, I went stright for Module 6: Responsive design. 
            </p>
            <p>Next to come: Module 6, WTF !?</p>
