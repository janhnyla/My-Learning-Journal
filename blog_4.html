            <h1>Next-Level JavaScript</h1>
            
            <p class="heading-text">There is still so much to learn,
            and I figured out that the place to learn more is at Scrimba. So, I signed up as a Pro Member! The next course i wanted to take,
        was the next JavaScript module available, and that was "Next-Level Javascript"</p>

            <h3>Next-Level Javascript</h3>
            <p>Both this course and the one I took as my second course (Essential JavaScript Concepts) is part of the 
                "The Frontend Develper Career Path". This consists of 13 modules, with more than 65 hrs of tutoring. For those 
                who complete the whole path - a job within Frontend programming is totally reachable! It consist of CSS, JavaScript, And
            learning about React and much more. More than enough to build great websites.</p>
            <p>I dont have plans for working full time with programming,  so that is not that important for me, that is why I 
                know jumped from Module 5 to Module 7, since JavaScript is what I wanted to learn. In this module, it was building
                a RPG-game the lessons was about. This was very very new stuff for me, but I learnt a lot!


            <p>The solo project in this module was building a Tinder-app for dogs :) you could of course change this to another
                animal (or whatever :) , I stayed with the original theme to save some time.
                <a href="https://comforting-queijadas-22083c.netlify.app/" target="_blank"> Have a look</a> on how my app turned out!</p>
            
            <p>Much of the work in the RPG-game was how to use Arrays and Objects, and various ways of using functions. First, you start with the basics ways of 
                function, and then you switch that code out with new and better ways of doing stuff. Also, you will learn about 
                Classes and Constructors, stuff that was totally new to me. I learned so much from this module, insane how much it is to get a grasp of!
                But - after finishing this module, haven't i learned enough to build up my project-script?
            </p>
            <p>Next to come: working with my project!</p>
