            alot of coding. Php, Mysql, CSS, HTML5 was already stuff I had used. I also had
            used some Javascript, but mostly as copy-paste-adjust from internet. Time to learn for real.</p>

            <h3>Searching for help.</h3>
            <p>The first years after thinking that this was way to complex for me to achieve on my own, I used
            <a href="http://www.freelancer.com" target="_blank">Freelancer.com</a> and tried to find a programmer
            who could do it for me. Boy - that was an experience. The first time, I made an agreement with someone who thought
            they could do it in a couple of weeks. I even payed a deposit on $50 so he could get started.
            Two weeks went, I got to se how far he had come, and it was way off what I was looking for. So, I took the deposit back, and put 
            the project to rest.
            </p>

            <p>I have tried two more times hiring someone, but the last two times, those who reached out turned down the project, it was simply to hard and time consuming.</p>
            <h3>I better find someone who can teach me.</h3>
            <p>I first enrolled Udemy.com, and figured that was a good place to learn Javascript. But it was not for me. So, by chance - when searching the net for answers - I came over Scrimba.</p>    
            <p>Wow! What a way of learning programming!! Coding directly into the "video" is simply brilliant. It was also a Norwegian teacher, even if it was on English - it is much easier for me to 
                understand a Norwegian talking English than and Indian doing the same. This was brilliant, and on this date (20.september), I got
                enrolled in the free Javascript course "Learn JavaScript for free"
