            <p class="heading-text">it`s been 10 days since last update, and this time has been used to learn basic React knowledge. Boy - this is hard, but I see 
                that in the next weeks or so, I should come to the conclution that React is the thing for me! I think?

            <h3>First segment: Build a React info site</h3>
            <p>It start up pretty easy, with building a static website. Much CSS, but you will learn some pretty basic stuff about React. Most important is 
                possible how you set up React localy on your computer, and upload to Netlify. You will learn what ReactDom.render is, and at the end you will 
                make your own Soloproject, a <a href="https://adorable-elf-73176a.netlify.app" target="_blank">digital business card.</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Second segment: Build an AirBnb Experience clone</h3>
            <p>In this segment, you learn a bit more about React. Props is a must to understand, and how you pass it from script to script. You will understand 
                that with Reach, you will devide your script into smaller script-bits. Why I really dont know yet, but maybe to get it more understandable? 
                I would much more prefer to have it all in one place, but then again I have never built a huge project, and possibly would feel otherwise if so.
                I have not posted my Soloproject on Netlify, but the Scrim is <a href="https://scrimba.com/scrim/co9d24b50936c72a378ef81f0" target="_blank">here: a travel journal</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Third Segment: Build a Meme generator</h3>
            <p>A fun project, and this is where  you really speed up the learning. I have done this segment twice. I first did about half, and took that one more time, before
                doing the same with the last part. Some hint on what you learn: Event listeners in React, useState, array destructuring, callback functions, refactoring and much more.
                It is at this stage I realise I should have done more to know the new ways of writing javascript (E6-something? With ternarys, arrows and so on), cause you need 
                to understand that. No Soloproject in this segment.
            </p>

           <h3>Whats next for me? </h3>
            <p>I am now pretty close to ending the Fourth Segment, but it is so much new that I really need to use time on this segment. useEffect is one of the
                key element you learn, and it is important to understand this good. So I will probably use rest of this year with this. 
                Sadly, I still haven't learnt what I need to proceed with my own project. I think..... Not sure, until I fully understand this last Segment :)
