            <h3>Oh, Maaaan</h3>
            <p>So - not to confuse you. This blog actually is the Solo project of module 6. The one i am doing right now. The NEW module 6</p>
            <p>I discovered this, when I tried to start working with my project again after finishing module 6. I had to go back to one
                of the Scrims and check out what setup Kevin Powell recommended for his CSS file. And then, the whole course was gone. And
                my percentage of completing "Frontend Developer" was showing that I had not taken the module. 
            </p>
            <p>I am pretty sure I learned a whole lot of display: Flex, built a website for a barbeque place and some more I dont
                remember now. It was not a solo project, so I havent saved any files (Note to my self after discovering this: take notes!)
            </p>
            <p>This means that I can not say so much about module 6 yet, since I am actually doing it again now (5th December). I 
                will come back to the current content later. But it was a good previous module 6, and the one active now is somewhat different,
                but boy - I learned alot from it the second time also. Hint: Grid.
            </p>
            <p>GOOD NEWS: as I have mentioned, I had to put my company to rest in August. I have been between jobs, one of the reason
                I had time to study. I have now got a new job, and in Januray I start my new job (in a bank)! Not with programming, though.
                This made me thinking: should i prioritize to learn so much as I can for my project, or should i finish all modules at Scrimba,
                so I get a sertificate on doing the "frontend Developer Career Path"? I chose the last, so I decided to go straight to.... module 1 :)
            </p>
            <p>Next to come: Module 1, Welcome to the Career Path</p>
