            <h3>CSS is fun!</h3>
            <p>This is the first course that focus really on CSS. And it handle many of the common use of CSS, so much of this
                is well known. But it is so good to get it explained real well! What made this module good to take, even if I have 
                used CSS for a long time when I built my current websites, is that you get explained so well the behaviour of
                margins and paddings, and how you add images - responsive - to your site. A lesson where I certainly took notes!
            </p>

            <p>I has taken me some time to go through module 1 - 3, mostly because i knew much of the stuff from before, 
                but also because I took some longer breaks. But even if it well known stuff, I decided that I should start 
                taking notes, and build up a library of small tip. "small" right? Turned out, there was so much I thought I knew,
                but as I did the solo projects, I still had to look up som answers both on Scrimba and on Net. This is something
                you all should remember: you will never learn enough! Always a better and easier solution you may not have thought 
                about previous. 
            </p>
            <h3>Solo Project: Oldagram</h3>
            <p>A fun challenge. The task is to build a clone of instagram, and the name Oldagram is because you build it with 
                people from good old days - the painters. People have probably in all ages loved portrait of them selves, and 
                back in the days you had to paint your selfie :)
            </p>

            <p>This project is CSS only, and you learn to use Flexbox and much more. You can take a look at my
